            <h3>Problem Statement</h3>
            <p>
            Making an itinerary when travel
            ing can get hectic and 
            when traveling to a new place, it can be an issue to find stuff to do. 
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="box">
            <h3>Solution</h3>
            <p>
            Make a website where people can put their input for traveling at a certain location. 
            People can post their itineraries for locations and other people can work off that.
            Overall, make the traveling experience much easier and less stressful.

        <h3>Key Problems</h3>
        <p>
            One of the takeaways from our competitive analysis research, based on popular sources (internet forums such as 
            Reddit and Rick Steveâ€™s website), is that there is a demand for itinerary sharing (particularly in the form of 
            receiving tailored feedback on a tentative plan a particular user has); however, such feedback seems to be either 
            lacking (as there are not enough reddit users in a given itinerary feedback community, ex.  
            A place to discuss travel itineraries), or the community they post the itinerary does not specifically focus on itinerary advice (just travel in general, ex. Travel Hacks).
